Welcome to **Sayar Kyan's personal programming blog**! ðŸ‘‹

This is where I document my adventures as a self-taught developer, sharing the lessons I learn, the challenges I overcome, and the projects I build along the way. Written primarily with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this blog is a reflection of my hands-on approach to learning and building.
