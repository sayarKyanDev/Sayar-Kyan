    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-text">
      Hello! I'm <strong>Hein Ko Ko Aung</strong>, a young and passionate programmer from <strong>Myanmar</strong>.
      I started my journey in the world of IT back in <strong>2019</strong> when I was just 12 years old.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      Since then, I’ve been learning various programming languages, building small projects, and solving real-world problems
      I encounter along the way. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies and always strive to improve my skills.
    </p>

    <div class="more-text" id="moreText">
      <p>
        This blog is my personal platform to share my experiences, tips, and mistakes, hoping to help others in their programming
        journey. Learning programming can be challenging, but it’s also exciting and rewarding when you start solving real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that learning by doing is the most powerful method — break things, fix them, and keep growing. The best part about
        programming is that there's always something new to learn, and the possibilities are endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am working on mobile app development, learning advanced Java, and exploring frameworks like Flutter. I aim to build
        useful and impactful projects in the future and contribute to the community.
